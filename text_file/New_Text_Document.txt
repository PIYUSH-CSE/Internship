Forward list in STL implements singly linked list. Introduced from C++11, 
forward list are more useful than other containers in insertion, removal, 
and moving operations (like sort) and allow time constant insertion and 
removal of elements. 
It differs from the list by the fact that the forward list keeps track of
 the location of only the next element while the list keeps track of both
 the next and previous elements, thus increasing the storage space required
 to store each element. The drawback of a forward list is that it cannot be
 iterated backward and its individual elements cannot be accessed directly. 
Forward List is preferred over the list when only forward traversal is 
required (same as the singly linked list is preferred over doubly linked
 list) as we can save space. Some example cases are, chaining in hashing,
 adjacency list representation of the graph, etc.
Operations on Forward List:
 
1. assign(): This function is used to assign values to the forward list, its
 other variant is used to assign repeated elements and using the values of another 
list.
// C++ code to demonstrate forward list
// and assign()
#include <forward_list>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
// Driver Code
int main()
{
    // Declaring forward list
    forward_list<int> flist1;
 
    // Declaring another forward list
    forward_list<int> flist2;
   
    //Declaring another forward list
      forward_list<int> flist3;
 
    // Assigning values using assign()
    flist1.assign({ 1, 2, 3 });
 
    // Assigning repeating values using assign()
    // 5 elements with value 10
    flist2.assign(5, 10);
   
   
      //Assigning values of list 1 to list 3
      flist3.assign(flist1.begin(), flist1.end());
 
    // Displaying forward lists
    cout << "The elements of first forward list are : ";
    for (int& a : flist1)
        cout << a << " ";
    cout << endl;
 
    cout << "The elements of second forward list are : ";
    for (int& b : flist2)
        cout << b << " ";
    cout << endl;
   
       
      cout << "The elements of third forward list are : ";
    for (int& c : flist3)
        cout << c << " ";
    cout << endl;
 
    return 0;
